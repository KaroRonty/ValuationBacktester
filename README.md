# ValuationBacktester
A simple backtester for valuation measures such as CAPE or P/B.

Returns annualized ten-year returns for each cut point.
Change the metric to be tested and its settings on lines 57-62.

A lower CAPE has lead to better returns annually during the next ten years, but the relationship between P/E and future ten year returns isn't as strong.
